This is a little game in python 2.7

## Goal

Well, of course, the purpose of this software is to develop your general culture, knowledge, and abilities. Naaa, just kidding, it's just to have fun. All you have to do is park the boats so they gets unpack, and go away. But if any boats collides with an other one, bad luck, you lose!

## Requirements

- python 2
- pygame
